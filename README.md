_`uv` is used as the package and project manager for this project. Install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)._

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync # all dependencies
uv sync --no-dev # only production dependencies
```

```bash
# Generates new migration files under `unicon_backend/migrations/versions`
# This should be ran after making changes to any database models under `unicon_backend/models`
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<description>"
```

# Set the database URL (`DATABASE_URL`) in the .env file / environment variable
# Migration files are located under `unicon_backend/migrations`
uv run alembic upgrade head

# By default, it seeds the database URL (`DATABASE_URL`) in the .env file / environment variable
uv run unicon_backend/cli.py seed <admin-username> <admin-password> \
    ./examples/addition/definitions/*.json \
    ./examples/problem_set/definition.json \

# By default, it initialises the schema stored at `unicon_backend/unicon.perm`
uv run unicon_backend/cli.py permify init

# Seed permission for records in the database
uv run unicon_backend/cli.py permify seed
